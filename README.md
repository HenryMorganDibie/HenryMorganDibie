I am a business administration graduate with over 5 years of experience in business growth and management. My engagement in company management has given me skills in sales, marketing, management, and customer service. After a few years of my experiences, I became increasingly conscious of the importance of data analytics for business success, which motivated me to improve my Machine Learning abilities through structured training and courses.
 
I have gained proficiency in the following :

• Business intelligence 
• Data Visualization (Power BI)
• Relational database SQL
* Machine Learning 
• Scikit Learn
• Python
• Deep Learning
• TensorFlow
• Keras
• Clustering
• Dimensionality reduction
• Natural Processing Language
• Image Processing
• PySpark

Which I believe are important technical skills that will allow me to succeed in and that emphasizes data or business analysis. Furthermore, I have great interpersonal skills and a strong work ethic, which will benefit my collaboration with other members of the team.
My current focus is on assisting businesses in structuring data to improve the outcomes of their operations. As a result, I anticipate that my contribution will assist any firm better in the following areas: business predictability, real-time data intelligence, data security, data-driven marketing and sales, developing models that can handle large amounts of data, and interpretation of big and complex data.
 
I am proactive and fast to learn, and I am excited to collaborate with and learn from the other team members in this area. If you're seeking a passionate and committed team player who will go to any length to ensure the success of your organization's established goals and overall vision, I feel I'm worth a shot.
