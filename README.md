I am a business administration graduate with over 5 years of experience in business growth and management. My engagement in company management has given me skills in sales, marketing, management, and customer service. After a few years of my experiences, I became increasingly conscious of the importance of data analytics for business success, which motivated me to improve my urge for data in Machine Learning, dealing with structured and unstructured data.

 I have proficiency in the following :
• Business intelligence 
• Data Visualization (Power BI, Excel)
• Relational database SQL
• Scikit Learn
• Python
• Deep Learning
• TensorFlow
• Keras
• Machine Learning

Which I believe are important technical skills that will allow me to succeed and that emphasize business analysis and machine learning.
Furthermore, I have great interpersonal skills and a strong work ethic, which will benefit my collaboration with other members of the team.
My current focus is on assisting businesses in structuring data to improve the outcomes of their operations. As a result, I anticipate that my contribution will assist any firm better in the following areas: business predictability, real-time data intelligence, predictive models, data-driven marketing and sales, developing models that can handle large amounts of data, and interpretation of big and complex data.
 
Building trustworthy relationships and igniting a common project vision is crucial, as I've learned from my experience working with cross-functional, worldwide teams. I have practical experience in creating effective project plans, outlining expectations in detail, and igniting team enthusiasm—even in the last stages of a project cycle. 

I am proactive and fast to learn, and I am excited to collaborate with and learn from the other team members in this area. If you're seeking a passionate and committed team player who will go to any length to ensure the success of your organization's established goals and overall vision, I feel I'm worth a shot.
